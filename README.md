# Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository

This Repository holds all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Project I have created.
In this I have analysed the COVID vaccination and Death due to COVID. And also calculated the vaccine efficacy for the people of different age groups.
From this project we can also infer the percentage of people affected by the vaccination and percentage of people that died even after the dose of vaccination.
